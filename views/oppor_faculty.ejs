                    NS is an interdisciplinary engineering department spanning the research areas of Computational Science and Engineering, and Data Sciences.  Computational science deals with computational methods, related mathematics and algorithms, and the design of high performance and scalable systems to support scientific and engineering applications. Data Science explores models, algorithms and scalable systems to extract knowledge and insight from both structured and unstructured data of various scales. NS invites applications in all areas of computational and data sciences that lie at the intersection of methods, systems and applications, specifically in the following topics.</p>
                    NS welcomes rolling applications, round-the-year,  from Indian nationals (including Persons of Indian Origins (PIOs) and Overseas Citizens of India (OCIs)) who are exceptionally motivated, with an established record of independent, high quality research, and a commitment to teaching. The department expects the candidates to have published in top-ranking fora in their areas of expertise. For an Assistant Professor position, the prospective candidates must have a PhD with at least 3 years of post-doctoral research experience (relaxable in exceptional cases) and be preferably below 35 years of age. Applicants for senior positions, in addition to a PhD degree, must be leaders with outstanding contributions in their area of research and a proven track-record of advising doctoral students.

                        The Indian Institute Of Information Technology (IIITA) is the premier graduate teaching and research institution in India, and is highly ranked on global metrics. Established over a century ago and located in the vibrant technology capital of Bangalore, IIITA is renowned for its academic freedom. Its focus on research excellence, quality of students and faculty, and leadership in national and international initiatives, are widely recognized. At a broad level, it operates in a very similar manner to the premier international research schools, with both faculty hiring and promotions based on rigorous assessment from leading international experts in the area. Similarly, student selection is based on highly-competitive examinations (such as GATE) and detailed technical interviews.

                        <br>
                        NS fully internalizes this creative academic ambience, and enriches it with a variety of unique facets. Interdisciplinary and collaborative research is strongly encouraged and supported, as is reflected in the current NS faculty profiles. A variety of labs are operational, and new faculty are encouraged to start labs in their focus areas. NS provides adequate lab space for meeting the need of individual faculty requirements. Also, exceptional computational infrastructure available at the Institute’s supercomputing centre (SERC), featuring the top-of-the-line hardware and software, allows for cutting-edge research in high-performance computing. Finally, the department is hosted in an aesthetically-pleasing spacious building with all modern amenities including ubiquitous wireless connectivity.
